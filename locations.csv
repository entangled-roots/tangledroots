Woodlands Community Garden,West Princes Street,G4 9BY,Glasgow,Growing,"Woodlands Community Garden opened in 2010, occupying a vacant site in West Princes Street. Since then it has become an important local space where people make new friends and feel part of the community. It’s also a great place to unwind from the everyday stresses and strains of city life. Each year, around 50 households grow their own fruit, vegetables and herbs in the garden’s raised beds. The garden is also the focus of many projects that we run with local partners.",,,https://www.woodlandscommunity.org.uk/community-garden,,green,55.870466,-4.271087
